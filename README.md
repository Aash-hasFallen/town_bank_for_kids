# town_bank_for_kids
Bank Town is an educational game prototype created for a national-level hackathon, aimed at introducing school students (ages 11–13) to basic banking concepts. The game replaces traditional explanations with interactive choices, visual feedback, and simple consequences to build early financial awareness in a playful way.
